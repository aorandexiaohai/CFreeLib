# Project Description

    The aim of this project is to build a simple and free library based on C language.

    It contains:
        1) generic data structure
        2) generic algorithm
        3) Thread pool
        ...

    All the components are both separate. For example, if you want to use DoubleList,
    run the following: 
        cd DoubleList
        cp ../FormatHelper/build_environment.py .
        python3 build_environment.py
    All the *.c. *.h in DoubleList are needed if you want to use the component.
